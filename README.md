# Syntax City Blog

Syntax City - An educational blog inspired by the movie Sin City, that teaches fundamentals of how to apply HTML and CSS as well as highlighting awesome dev tools for creators to implement into their daily code flow.

The landing page will feature the name of the blog with a button to access the main content of the blog.

the main content layout will be a parallax scroll that will feature banners with text, images and quotes that scroll the screen as the user traverses down the page.

All colors will be swatches from the Sin City movie. Text will be a mix between a sketch style and rounded letters. This will create a neat contrast throughout the blog.

The background will be dark with a opaque black/white linear gradient
